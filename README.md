# advent-of-code-2021
Rust solutions for the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) challenges.

Build template taken from awesome [Marc Noirot](https://github.com/noirotm).

As the purpose of this repository is to improve my Rust level, code quality is probably on the lower end.

Note: I started this challenge during AoC-2022 challenge, so progress will be very slow.
